            <p>"Hello, World" was first seen in the book: A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B. The book was written by Brain Kernighan and published in 1978.  The author has stated he can't remember when or why he choose those the saying "Hello, World".  The "Hello, World" program is usually the first program written when learning a programming language. The program is simple and is written so the text "Hello, World" is displayed somewhere on the screen for the user to see.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Javascript">
            <header>Javascript</header>
            <p>JavaScript (which has no actual relation to Java), is a scripting language developed originally for use in web browsers. Because of that, it has a built-in facility for dealing with the Document Object Model, the in-memory representation of the content of a webpage. It is the primary programming language for front-end web development.</p>
            <code>// Hello world in JavaScript<br>
                <br>
                console.log("Hello World");</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Java">
            <header>Java</header>
            <p>Java is a high-level language designed to be used by the Java Virtual Machine. It has very few external dependencies, and was intended to be able to run on any physical machine. It is used a lot in network architecture and also in embedded devices, kiosks, and other in situ computing applications.</p>
            <code>// Hello World in Java<br>
                    <br>
                    class HelloWorld {<br>
                      &nbsp;static public void main( String args[] ) {<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println( "Hello World!" );<br>

        <section class="main-section" id="Python">
            <header>Python</header>
            <p>Python is a high-level programming language. It is an interpreted (not compiled) language, also known as a “scripting language.” It is mostly used as a tool for performing ad hoc programming tasks such as task automation and data analysis. Python 3 is the latest iteration of the Python language.</p>
            <code># Hello world in Python 3 (aka Python 3000)<br>
                    <br>
                    print("Hello World")</code>

            <header>PHP</header>
            <p>PHP is the most popular server-side language on the internet today. It is incredibly powerful yet easy to learn.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="C++">
            <header>C++</header>
            <p>Originally “C with Classes,” C++ is, in many ways, simply a more advanced successor to C (though the situation is a lot more complicated than that). C++ was developed to add high-level programming paradigms to C, while retaining the low-level hardware-manipulation capabilities.</p>
            <code>// Hello World in C++<br>

            <p>Used as the primary language for .NET programming, and much like C++, it is an extension of the C programming language with the major addition being object-oriented capabilities.</p>

            <p>Microsoft TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
