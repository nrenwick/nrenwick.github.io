                Homer Jay Simpson was born on May 12, 1956. He was raised on the Simpson farm by his parents until they
                were forced to move out due to Homer scaring the cows by jumping out of a bale of hay and scaring them
                into giving sour milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began
                drinking alcohol, and accidentally caused a traffic jam in his Playschool car.

                Homer attended Springfield High School and fell in love with Marge Bouvier. After graduating, Marge and
                Homer bought an apartment at Springfield Place together. During this time, Marge got a letter accepting
                her into a college. To pay for her tuition, Abe gives Homer a job at Simpson Laser Tag. The couple broke
                up for some time after Homer started a Grunge band called Sadgasm. Marge realizes that she really loves
                Homer, and she goes back to him.[18] At some point between finishing high school and marrying Marge,
                Homer briefly served in the US Army, but never saw combat. Due to a clerical error, he was discharged
                two weeks early and years later after a disastrous dinner party with his old sergeant, Homer was forced
                to complete his tour of duty.

                When the couple were in their mid-20s, Marge became pregnant with Bart. At this time Homer was working
                at Sir Putt-A-Lot's Merrie Olde Fun Centre, turning the crank that spins the windmill. The two got
                married in Shotgun Pete's 24 Hour Wedding Chapel, a small wedding chapel across the state line. They
                spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop, before ending up at the Bouvier House, where they
                lived at the time. After failing to get a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer left Marge
                to find a job by which he could support his family. He went to work at a taco restaurant called the Gulp
                'n' Blow until Marge found him and convinced him to return home with her. As a result, Homer confronted
                Mr. Burns and secured a job at the Plant. Two years after Bart was born, Marge became pregnant with
                Lisa, shortly before they bought their first house. Homer's second leap to stardom was his success as
                the lead singer and songwriter for the barbershop quartet The Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During
                his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent from home, which put stress on his marriage. After
                the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield to continue his old life.
